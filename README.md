# Memory Game Project
This is a little game made up for the **FEND Udacity** course so a real challenge for a newby. It is the classical game where you must find the pair that match.
You can find the detailed instructions for the creation of this project here: [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

There are plenty of gadgets to add to this game. But this is a study project so I want to keep only my code. However if you have some suggestion or ideas they would be welcome.
