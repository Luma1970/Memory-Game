# Memory Game Project
This is a little game made up for the **FEND Udacity** course so a real challenge for a newby. It is the classical game where you must find the pair that match.
You can find the detailed instructions for this project here: [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

## Instructions

Clic on a card, clic on the second if they do match is good, if they don't remeber the symbols and go on! When all the cards will have their mate, you win :-)

## Contributing

There are plenty of gadgets to add to this game. But this is a study project so I want to keep only my code. However if you have some suggestion or ideas they would be welcome.
